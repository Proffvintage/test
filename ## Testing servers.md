 ## Testing servers

This is a simple HTML file with a little bit of JavaScript to test how the server is working.

### Step-by-step explanation of the code

1. The HTML file starts with the standard HTML header, including the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, the `<html>` tag, and the `<head>` tag.

2. Inside the `<head>` tag, there is a `<meta>` tag that sets the character encoding to UTF-8, and a `<meta>` tag that sets the viewport to be responsive.

3. The `<title>` tag sets the title of the page to "Testing servers".

4. The `<body>` tag contains the content of the page.

5. Inside the `<body>` tag, there is an `<h2>` tag that displays the heading "This is just to test how it all works".

6. There is also a `<p>` tag that displays the text "Javascript sucks".

7. Finally, there is a `<script>` tag that contains the JavaScript code.

8. The JavaScript code starts by declaring three variables: `t1`, `t2`, and `t3`.

9. The `t1` variable is assigned the value "Good".

10. The `t2` variable is assigned the value "Morning".

11. The `t3` variable is assigned the value "Sucker".

12. The `t4` variable is assigned the value of the concatenation of the `t1`, `t2`, and `t3` variables.

13. The `document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML` line of code gets the element with the id "demo" and sets its innerHTML property to the value of the `t4` variable.

This will cause the text "GoodMorningSucker" to be displayed on the page.
